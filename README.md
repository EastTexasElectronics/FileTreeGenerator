# File Tree Generator (ftg)

## Purpose

This tool is a command-line utility written in several languages that generates a visual representation of the directory tree structure. It allows you to:

- Exclude specific files or directories
- Specify an output location
- Interactively select items to exclude

## Overview

I created a file tree generator tool in Zsh and got curious about how it would perform in other languages. This project has been an exercise in learning and experimenting with different programming languages.

## Which One Should I Use?

### Most Complete and Tested

- **Zsh**: This version is the most complete and has been thoroughly tested. It is the main version of this tool.

### Fastest

- **Rust** and **Go**: These languages blow away the competition in terms of speed.

### Most Reliable

- **Zsh**: This is the version I have been using for a while and is the most reliable.

## Installation

To install a version of the tool, please select your desired language and follow the instructions in the corresponding README.md file for that version.

## Contributing

This is a work in progress, and I will be adding more languages and features as I learn more. Please feel free to contribute to this project by adding your own languages and features.
